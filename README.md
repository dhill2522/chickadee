# Project Chickdee
> A simplified version of HERON, allowing more interactivity in the process

The goal of this project is to be a testing-grounds for design and dispatch optimization. This project is meant to stay light, fast and flexible like a Chickadee rather than becoming monolithic.

## Requirements
- Needs to be able to support the "same algorithms" as HERON for dispatching
- Needs to be a flexible place for quickly and simply messing around with dispatch/design opt
- WILL NOT use an xml file as input, but be built as an importable python library
- Has to be useable with various optimizers and with various optimization schemes
- Has to be able to support the same type of components as HERON


## Ideas to experiment with
- Adding DAEs
- Support for timing, allowing optimization of algorithm
